# Welcome to the Harvest To Order User Guide

**This user guide is designed to help you get the most out of the Harvest To Order platform to support the operation of local food enterprises and “local food chains” wherever you live.**

## An overview

The Harvest To Order enables local people to build better, fairer ways to source their food locally and directly from growers, farmers and producers. Expansive networks of small food producers, distributors, retailers, food hubs, food co-ops and buying groups can come together with the aid of the Harvest To Order to find the best way of shortening the food supply chain. And in the process it helps to build strong communities.

The Harvest To Order is a global project that supports the operational organisation of farmers, groups of consumers, cooperatives, etc. in the distribution of local food. The software we build is open source, and we collaborate with amazing people from all over the world to keep improving it! We also provide support in the organisational aspects of setting up and running a food hub.
